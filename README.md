# Quantum Wavefunction Evolution Simulation

This project provides an interactive simulation of quantum mechanics using a Gaussian wave packet. The simulation allows users to visualize the evolution of the wavefunction over time and understand core quantum mechanical concepts.

## Description

The goal of this project is to simulate the time evolution of a quantum wave packet in one dimension. The wave packet is initialized with specific parameters, such as its position and momentum, and the evolution of the wavefunction is computed using the **Crank-Nicolson method** for time evolution.

This simulation gives insights into the **quantum mechanical wavefunction** and its probability distribution |\psi(x,t)|^2, which describes the likelihood of a particle's position at any given time.
