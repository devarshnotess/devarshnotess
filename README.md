# Quantum Wavefunction Evolution Simulation

This project provides an interactive simulation of quantum mechanics using a Gaussian wave packet. The simulation allows users to visualize the evolution of the wavefunction over time and understand core quantum mechanical concepts.

## Description

The goal of this project is to simulate the time evolution of a quantum wave packet in one dimension. The wave packet is initialized with specific parameters, such as its position and momentum, and the evolution of the wavefunction is computed using the **Crank-Nicolson method** for time evolution.

This simulation gives insights into the **quantum mechanical wavefunction** and its probability distribution |\psi(x,t)|^2, which describes the likelihood of a particle's position at any given time.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: Use sliders to adjust the initial position x_0, initial momentum k_0, and time step.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Watch the wavefunction evolve over time with dynamic, real-time updates.
- **Visualization**: Displays the probability density |\psi(x,t)|^2 using interactive graphs.
- **Educational Tool**: Great for students and anyone interested in learning more about quantum mechanics.
